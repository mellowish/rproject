1. Which lags are most associated with malaria incidence for temperature and total rainfall?

2. Which region has the most malaria?

3. In which regions is rainfall high? Temperature? How much do these variables vary across the country?

4. Are cases clustered in a particular area of Mozambique? How does this overlap with rainfall and temperature? (think about maps here)

5. Is malaria incidence going down or up over time? Does this depend on which region weâ€™re looking at?
